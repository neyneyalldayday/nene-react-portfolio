                <p>A fullstack software developer. I come from a background of video production and editing.</p>
                <p>Around three years ago i got into building p.c. computers. learning the inner workings of what makes a p.c work.</p> 
                <p>The natural pogression was learning how to communicate with the p.c.</p>
