    paragraphOne: 'I graduated from a software engineering bootcamp through utsa mid january 2021, it is now march 1st. since then ive been organizing the work ive done over the past 24 weeks. Putting my ducks in a row for the career services dept. I have some projects in the oven right now, some band portfolios and artist comerce pages. I have a p.c. building swap shop in the works too for people into custom p.c computers. hopfully it can help build a community through this tough crypto mining time in the p.c. building corner of the world',
    paragraphTwo: 'Aside from actual building. In the past month, winter storms aside i have been practicing my raw programming. That continues to be the more dificult side of things for me. And not in the "think like a programmer" way a lot of people try to preach(think like a programmer makes complete sense, not discounting the advice). For me in syntax, remembering how to communicate my problem solving skills to the computer. So ive been going back to the basics of vanilla javascript with es6 in mind. I am just trying to have fun programming. Its funny to say that because someone watching me solve a bug would not think im having fun. Kinda like getting stuck in a Video Game ',
