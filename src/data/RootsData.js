    paragraphOne: 'We are gonna go back, way back. The first major challenge in my life. The number one thing that taught me i could achieve anything i put my mind to. That thing is BMX. i started when i was around 16. my first trip to the skate park i had that moment where everthing looked so easy. well that quickly changed after my first roll in, or i guess i should say roll up. The moment i got to the top of the first quarter pipe ive ever rode, i froze up. I had that oh man what now moment, we all know that moment. Well you can guess what met me next. Concrete',
    paragraphTwo: 'This was that first fork in the road moment. Not only did it hurt physically, id say mentally it hurt too. AM I GONNA EVER BE GOOD ENOUGH TO DO THIS (sound familiar?). Are my peers judging me? Do i look like a fool? These thoughts constantly come up while true progression is happening. Its not untill you look back from year to year that you see that you infact through all the bumps and bruises are in fact good enough and no one is judging. In fact they are praising. Every thing in life has the abillity to make you freeze up and question yourself. The true test is how long you can move forward through the struggle of learning to finally see results in all the struggle',
