                    A little about me, my name is Rene Trevino. A fullstack software developer. I come from a background of video production and editing.
                    Around three years ago i got into building p.c. computers. learning the inner workings of what makes a p.c work. With a software user 
                    background and next understanding the hardware. The natural pogression was learning how to communicate with the p.c. So here we are.
                    at the time of writing this we are on 2021's doorstep about to knock. I look forward to my new adventure in the comming year. Its nice 
                    to look backa and see all the progress made.                
                </p>
